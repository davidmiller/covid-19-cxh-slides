# Caveat emptor

#

This is written by two respiratory doctors for an audience that includes operation doctors in the midst of a pandemic; it's a fluid situation, lots of research is being done and information contained within may become stale quickly. If you spot a bug or inaccuracy please ping me at [drcjar@gmail.com](drcjar@gmail.com) or submit a pull request [https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/](https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/) and I will fix.

# Learning objectives

#

At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to...

- define sars-cov2 and covid-19
- describe basic epidemiology of covid-19
- summarize the key clinical features of covid-19 

# sars-cov2 and covid-19

#

- severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2) is the bug; Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is the pneumonia that the bug causes

#

- sars-cov2 is a large RNA virus (approximately 120 nm in diameter) from a family of viruses called coronaviruses. Corona means crown; it's called coronavirus because the virus is spherical and has spikes which look like a crown when viewed down an electron microscope.

# basic epidemiology of covid-19

#

-  WHO informed of outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019; declared public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020; declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020

#

- covid-19 is increasingly common in the UK population just now; for most people it's a mild self-limiting disease characterised by cough and fever secondary to respiratory infection with sars-cov2; however, some people need hospital admission and some of those need ITU.

# 

- demand for hospital admission and ITU will shortly outstrip supply; case fatality rate is probably around 1% (country figures depend on case definition and how much testing is done). no significant sex difference, risk factors for hospital admission include having contact with a confirmed case, being older, being a healthcare worker, having comorbidities such as pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, smoking.

#

- droplet (can't travel more than 1m, can persist on surfaces, surgical mask helpful) +/- aerosol transmission (can travel more than 1m, surgical mask not helpful).

# key clinical features of covid-19 

# 

- it's a chamelion (can present in lot of different ways, can hide in plain view)

#

- typical presentation is cough and fever
- other features include breathless, fatigue, myalgia, anorexia
- less often chest pain (2-5%), GI (D&V 1-10%, abdo pain approx 2%) and neurological symptoms e.g headache confusion (9%), dizziness (9-12%)

# 

- differential diagnosis broad; plenty of diseases can mimic including flu, disease can also co-exist
- no reason to think usual population disease are going to go away so Hickam's dictum likely to apply: "A man can have as many diseases as he damn well pleases."

#

- investigations to confirm diagnosis (and rule out differentials) and grade severity
- basics include SpO2 (+/- abg), fbc (lymphopenia common), crp, d-dimer (high d-dimer assoc with increased mortality), CXR (bilateral inflitrates), nasopharyngeal and oropharngeal swabs and sputum for micro

#

- management is largely supportive (several ongoing drug trials) and prognosis good (naturally it's much less good for subset of patients unwell enough for hospital admission)
- important to consider non-covid19 disease
- important to consider, and discuss with patients and document, ceilings of care
