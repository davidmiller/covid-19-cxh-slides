# Caveat emptor

#

This is written by two respiratory doctors for an audience that includes operation doctors in the midst of a pandemic; it's a fluid situation, lots of research is being done and information contained within may become stale quickly. If you spot a bug or inaccuracy please ping me at [drcjar@gmail.com](drcjar@gmail.com) or submit a pull request [https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/](https://github.com/drcjar/covid-19-cxh-slides/) and I will fix.

# Learning objectives

#

At the conclusion of this activity, participants will be able to...

- define sars-cov2 and covid-19
- describe basic epidemiology of covid-19
- summarize the key clinical features of covid-19 

# sars-cov2 and covid-19

#

- severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2) is the bug; Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is the pneumonia that the bug causes

#

- sars-cov2 is a large RNA virus (approximately 120 nm in diameter) from a family of viruses called coronaviruses. Corona means crown; it's called coronavirus because the virus is spherical and has spikes which look like a crown when viewed down an electron microscope.

# basic epidemiology of covid-19

#

-  WHO informed of outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019; declared public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020; declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020

#

- covid-19 is increasingly common in the UK population just now; for most people it's a mild self-limiting disease characterised by cough and fever secondary to respiratory infection with sars-cov2; however, some people need hospital admission and some of those need ITU.

# 

- demand for hospital admission and ITU will shortly outstrip supply; case fatality rate is probably around 1% (country figures depend on case definition and how much testing is done). no significant sex difference, risk factors for hospital admission include being older, being a healthcare worker, and having comorbidities such as pre-existing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.

#

- droplet +/- aerosol transmission

#

- cardinal clinical features are cough and fever
-- breathless common
